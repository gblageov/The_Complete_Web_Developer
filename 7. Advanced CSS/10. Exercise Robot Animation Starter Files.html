<p>It's time to create your new robot friend. But he needs some assembly first! Using everything you learned in this section, and your best friend: Google Developer Tools in the browser, try to assemble your new robot friend. <br><br>If you get stuck, in the next lecture you will find my solution (but remember that there are many solutions to this layout problem).<br><br>Once you are done, customize your robot, and add any animation you want. Then, you can submit it to our Discord in the <strong>#css</strong> channel for myself and others to view! You can send your CSS and HTML5 files or screen capture your robot. <br><br>PS - if you have any questions, reach out to our student community in the<strong> #css</strong> or <strong>#helpme</strong> channel on Discord (Lecture 3 provides the link if you have not yet joined)!<br><br>Good luck!</p>
