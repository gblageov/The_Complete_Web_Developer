<p><strong>Before we get started, let's do a quick activity that won't take you more than 5 minutes. </strong><br><br><strong>#1 </strong>Please introduce yourself in the community Discord group in the <strong>#introductions</strong> channel to get familiar with how it works! If you don't have Discord, please go to the previous lecture to see how to get it. Quickly share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to do this course. Doing this course yourself is completely fine, but it is always good to have a community of others, similar to you, helping you when you need motivation, and sharing in the joy when you succeed.<br><br><strong>#2 </strong>Go to the <strong>#programming-buddies.</strong> I want everyone here to find a partner to work with. We all need a programming buddy, so that is what we'll be doing today, finding programming buddies<strong>! You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. </strong>I know it may sound silly, but this is the biggest factor in completing the course. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends / coworkers this way. <br><br>Some of the channels available for you to join:<br><strong>#js - </strong>For all questions javascript<br><strong>#dev-resources - </strong>Myself and others share interesting articles and tools we find. Great way to stay up to date in the industry<br><strong>#alumni - </strong>Ask graduates of this course questions<br><strong>#womenintech - </strong>For the female coders out there<br><strong>#job-hunting - </strong>Anything related to finding a job as a developer<br><strong>#code100 - </strong>To join a community of students dedicated to code every day for 100 days. You can join anytime.<br>....and many many more!<br></p><p><strong>Trust me, the Discord community is an invaluable part of this course (some would say, it is the best part of this course!). You can also follow me on twitter where I send announcement about coding challenges we run monthly: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/AndreiNeagoie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>@andreineagoie</strong></a><br></p><p>Please note-- <em>This is a place for people to learn how to code, go through their careers and meet others around the world with the same interest: technology.  But we also have students all over the world with different cultural beliefs. Please be sensitive that people have different beliefs than you and keep your conversations about something we can all agree on: Coding is awesome. If you come across any behaviour that you find upsetting or concerning, we have a group of student volunteers who Manage the community. You can report issues anytime by messaging them privately or by using the @Management Team in your message. Please be </em>respectful towards your fellow coders and make everyone feel welcome :)</p>
