<p>The time is here! Many of you have been asking on Discord when our group projects / open source projects will begin.</p><p><strong>Well, today is the start of something amazing with our community of 50,000 students:</strong>  You can now <strong>join open source projects created by our community</strong>, and then <strong>work with fellow students to build the next app or startup</strong>. Why would you want to do this?</p><ol><li><p>Working in teams with fellow students will prepare you for the job market where you will be working with others using Github. </p></li><li><p> You can expand your portfolio by adding projects you have worked on with others. </p></li><li><p> You contribute to open source.</p></li><li><p> On your resume, you will be able to showcase that you started an open source project and self organized with your fellow students. I don't know about you, but I would hire someone who shows initiative like that :). </p></li></ol><p><strong>So how do you get started?<br><br>There is a special section I have added to the course: "Git + Github + Open Source Projects" where I take you through a step by step video on how to contribute to open source projects.<br><br></strong>However, I only recommend starting to contribute to open source<strong> once you get to that section. </strong>I put this quick lesson here in case someone who has a bit of experience already with development wants to get started on this right away. Otherwise, see you in that section!</p><p><br></p>
