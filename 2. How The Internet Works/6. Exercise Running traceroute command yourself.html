<p>Open up the Terminal (Mac), or Command Prompt (Windows) and run traceroute on any website you want. Keep in mind that on windows you will have to run <strong>tracert</strong> instead of <strong>traceroute<br></strong></p>

<p>For Mac users you can open the terminal this way: <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Instructions</a>
<br>
For Windows users you can open the command prompt this way: <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Open-the-Command-Prompt-in-Windows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Instructions</a><br><br></p>









<p>For Windows users, to interpret <strong>tracert</strong>, check out this: <a href="https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/how-to/read-traceroute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/how-to/read-traceroute. <br></a><br></p><p><strong>If you see the IP addresses a little bit different than in my videos or the links above: </strong>The IP addresses you see may be IPv6. In this case, you will have to run:<em> </em> <code>tracert -4 google.com</code>  which forces IPv4 hops<br><br><strong>If you see ***** (asterisk) in your output: </strong>If a packet is not acknowledged within the expected timeout (5seconds), an asterisk is displayed. Sometimes this can be due to your internet connection or <em><code>traceroute</code> </em> may show ****  because of widespread use of firewalls and other security practices by the company that owns that server.</p>
