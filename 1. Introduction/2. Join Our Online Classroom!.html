In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for employment this year, we are introducing a Discord online classroom where you can: </p><p><strong>- Introduce yourself <br>- Ask the community questions  <br>- Get help with exercises <br>- Meet other students around the world  <br>- Learn how to answer questions <br>- Learn from each other</strong></p><p>Many students have said this is the best part of the course as you will feel like you are learning in a classroom rather than by yourself in front of a computer. I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. <strong>The Discord community should give you faster replies to your questions from the community, while learning another valuable tool of a programmer. </strong><br>
I hope you find it useful. <strong>To join the group, go</strong> <a href="https://discord.gg/dKknDrv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to this link here.</a> Once there, you can sign up and click on channels to explore different topics.  <br><br> I'll see you in there, and let's make this year great!<br><br><br>(Thanks to Pavel, a fellow student, for contributing the below icon!)</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/dKknDrv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Join by clicking here: https://discord.gg/nVmbHYY</a><br><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-04-30_11-16-17-6fd45185cec533f952726fc84729768b.png"></figure><p><br></p>
