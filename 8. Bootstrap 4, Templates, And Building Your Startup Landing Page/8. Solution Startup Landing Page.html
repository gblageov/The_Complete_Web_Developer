<p>Did you skip building your own landing page? No problem, I have provided my files for you to use in the following videos. If you have your own startup page, you can go ahead and use that instead :)<br><br>By the way: The Bootstrap4 stylesheet file that I use is a specific version. If you grab the most current Bootstrap file for your website, you will see the button grow transition being a lot faster than in my video. Use whichever style sheet you like best! <br><br>PS - if you have any questions, reach out to our student community in the <strong>#helpme</strong> channel on Discord (Lecture 3 provides the link if you have not yet joined)!</p>
